  <main>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      FUN REALMS GAMES (“we,” “our,” or “us”) develops free mobile games designed for users of all ages, including families and children, in compliance with Google Play and applicable data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal and non-personal data when you use our mobile applications (“Service”). By using our apps, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
    <p>We value your privacy. Our games are designed to collect minimal personal information.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <p>
      We generally do not require personal data to use our games. However, some optional features (e.g., login, leaderboard, or support requests) may require you to provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name or nickname</li>
      <li>Email address (for customer support or account recovery)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used only for the purpose it was collected and is not shared with third parties except as outlined below.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>
      Our apps may automatically collect limited information for analytics, app performance, and crash reporting. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (model, OS version, unique identifiers)</li>
      <li>App usage data (screens visited, time spent)</li>
      <li>Crash logs or error reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This helps us improve gameplay experience and app stability.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
      We use third-party SDKs that may collect limited, non-personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
      Below are links to the privacy policies of our service providers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>

      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Family Policy and Child Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      We take children’s privacy very seriously and comply with the Google Play Families Policy and COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our games do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in certain regions).</li>
      <li>We do not request location data, contact access, or other sensitive permissions in child-directed experiences.</li>
      <li>We do not use behavioral advertising or personalized ads in apps directed to children.</li>
      <li>Third-party SDKs used in our family-friendly titles are configured to use child-safe, non-personalized modes.</li>
      <li>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com">incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com</a>, and we will delete the information immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services do not use cookies directly. However, third-party SDKs (like Firebase or Google Play Services) may use identifiers to improve analytics or app performance. You can opt out of interest-based ads by visiting your device’s settings.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
      We may employ third-party companies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitate our Service</li>
      <li>Provide analytics or crash reporting</li>
      <li>Improve gameplay experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These companies have access only to limited, necessary data and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, please note that no electronic storage or transmission method is 100% secure. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information but cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services may contain links to external websites or content. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third-party sites. Please review their privacy policies before engaging with them.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
