      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>FUN REALMS GAMES (“we”, “our”, or “us”) builds free mobile games distributed via Google Play and other app stores. We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about the data we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect it. This policy describes how we collect, store, use, share, and protect information obtained through our mobile applications (the “Apps” or “Service”).</p>
      <p>By installing or using our Apps you consent to the collection and processing described in this policy. If you are under the age of 13 (or under 16 where applicable), please review the section <strong>Children’s Privacy</strong> below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

      <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>Some features (optional) may ask you to supply personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name or nickname (displayed on leaderboards)</li>
        <li>Email address (support, account recovery)</li>
        <li>Support messages, feedback, or bug reports</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>When you use our Apps, we (and our third-party SDKs) may automatically collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device information: model, OS version, device identifiers (advertising ID / instance ID), language, screen size</li>
        <li>App usage data: session times, levels played, feature usage, in-app events</li>
        <li>Performance and stability: crash logs and error reports</li>
        <li>Non-precise location: country-level or coarse location derived from IP (used for analytics and compliance)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Advertising & Analytics Identifiers</h3>
      <p>We and our partners use device advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID) and other identifiers for analytics and advertising purposes. These are non-personal identifiers tied to your device rather than to your name or email address.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Purposes & Legal Basis (where applicable)</h2>
      <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide and maintain the Service:</strong> allow the app to function, save progress, leaderboards, and support features.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics & improvement:</strong> understand game usage, player behaviors, improve features, and fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising & monetization:</strong> deliver ads (personalized or non-personalized) and manage ad revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Support & communication:</strong> respond to support requests and notify users about critical updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal & safety:</strong> comply with laws, prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where required (for users in the EU/EEA), our legal bases for processing include: your consent, legitimate interests (game improvement, fraud prevention), and compliance with legal obligations. For analytics and personalized ads we rely on consent when necessary.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Advertising & Personalization</h2>
      <p>Our Apps monetize through ads (AdMob and other ad networks). Ads may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> targeted based on user interests and identifiers (requires consent where required).</li>
        <li><strong>Non-personalized ads:</strong> based on contextual information and not using personal data.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="boxed">
        <strong>Family / Child-Directed Experiences:</strong> For any app or section of an app identified as child-directed, we will not show personalized ads and we configure ad SDKs (AdMob and others) to serve non-personalized ads only. We follow Google Play Families Policy and COPPA requirements.
      </div>

      <h3>How to manage ad personalization</h3>
      <p>You may opt out of personalized ads via:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your device settings (e.g., Google Ads Settings)</li>
        <li>Ad SDK-specific opt-out links (provided by the ad provider)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For Google: visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">adssettings.google.com</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Third-Party SDKs, Services & Partners</h2>
      <p>We use third-party services to provide core app functionality, analytics, monetization, and crash reporting. These providers may collect data as described in their own policies. We require partners to respect user privacy and, where applicable, configure SDKs appropriately for family-friendly / child-directed modes.</p>

      <h3>Major SDKs & services we use (examples)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Firebase (Google) — Analytics for Firebase, Crashlytics, Remote Config</li>
        <li>Google Play Services & Google Play Billing</li>
        <li>Google AdMob (ads & mediation)</li>
        <li>Unity Analytics / Unity Services</li>
        <li>GameAnalytics</li>
        <li>Facebook SDK (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Each of these providers has its own privacy policy and terms. We encourage you to review their policies to understand their data practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & Families Policy)</h2>
      <p>We take children’s privacy seriously:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apps or sections of apps that we designate as child-directed will limit data collection and will not collect personal information from children under 13 (or under 16, where local law requires) without verified parental consent.</li>
        <li>We will not serve personalized (behavioral) ads in child-directed experiences. Ad SDKs are configured to request non-personalized ad treatment for child-directed content (e.g., using COPPA/child-directed settings where supported).</li>
        <li>We only use analytics SDKs in child-directed experiences when configured for limited data collection and non-personalized modes. We do not collect precise location or contact lists for children’s experiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information without consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com">incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com</a>. We will promptly investigate and delete the data if required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Data Sharing & Transfers</h2>
      <p>We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service providers who perform services on our behalf (analytics, ads, crash reporting)</li>
        <li>Platform providers (Google, Unity) as required to operate the app</li>
        <li>Law enforcement or regulators when required by law</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some service providers are located outside your country. When personal data is transferred internationally, we use contractual safeguards and only work with trusted providers who maintain appropriate security measures.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes described above or to comply with legal obligations. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crash logs and analytics: typically retained for up to 26 months depending on the provider and settings</li>
        <li>Support requests and emails: retained until request resolution plus a short period for record-keeping</li>
        <li>Account information (if applicable): retained until account deletion or inactivity for a reasonable period</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA & similar)</h2>
      <p>If you are located in certain jurisdictions (EU/EEA, UK, California, etc.), you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your personal data</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing</li>
        <li>Request data portability</li>
        <li>Opt out of sale or sharing (where applicable under local law)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com">incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com</a>. We may request information to verify your identity before responding.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data. However, no system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of information transmitted to or stored by our Apps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. Links to Third-Party Sites</h2>
      <p>Our Apps may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those third parties. Please review their privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will publish the updated policy here with a new effective date. Continued use of our Apps after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>13. Contact & Data Requests</h2>
      <p>If you have questions, concerns, or wish to make a request (access, deletion, or other), please contact:</p>
      <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com">incignitemanagement.1@gmail.com</a></p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>14. Additional Notes for Google Play / Developers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We provide accurate answers in the Google Play Console Data Safety form regarding types of data collected, purposes, and whether data is shared.</li>
        <li>We declare the use of advertising SDKs and analytics SDKs; child-directed content is configured to opt out of personalized ads and limit data collection.</li>
        <li>If using Play Games Services or in-app purchases, we follow platform policies for user data and financial transactions.</li>
      </ul>
